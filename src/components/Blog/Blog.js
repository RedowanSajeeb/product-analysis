            <p>There many hooks are introduced in the 2 or 3 earlier versions of REACT.
Context Api is a special kind of hooks <br />
Context Api replaces Redux
Context Api solves deep prop-drilling <br />
Before Context Api if we want share state with deeply nested components we had share the state via props of every child components. That was very painful
<br />
*When we have Context Api, we wrap parent component with a provider provided by context Api
And we also export the context to use it on other places <br />
.At last in this way we can share our states without the pain of props-drilling

           1.Semantic Tags indicates what they actually are <br />
           2.Semantic Elements provide the real meaning to browser and to the coders <br />
           3.Bold tag doesn't mean anything except displaying something on the webpage <br />
           4.But for example, 'p'* Paragraph element gives us the proper meaning to it's tagname and it clearly tells us to be a paragraph <br />
           5.And also helps the browser to render the p* tag as a paragraph <br />
           ...There are many semantic tags introduces in HTML5
header, footer, main, section. article, aside, etc
